Money only helps keep score. \r\nBosco Mad Men is an event that puts to test the participants\u2019 ability to conceive of a ground-breaking idea and to be able to believe in their idea even when the world thinks that the idea is bound to be doomed and fraught with perils. The budding Entrepreneurs\u2019 shall dawn the hat of a Venture Capitalist! The flagship business event for Bosco Fest\u201916 this year has been sub-divided into two segments, which are part of the same event which makes it a frenetic roller-coaster ride for our budding Entrepreneurs\u2019.The entire event will take place in the framework of the schools being divided into different blocks. The significance of the blocks have been explained in the general rules. \r\n\r\nSince it\u2019s about chasing the vision, not the money; the money will end up following you!\r\nLet the hustle begin! \r\n\r\n\r\nBOSCO DRAGONS DEN\r\n\r\nThe first event of Bosco Mad Men requires each school to come up with a novel yet financially sound business plan for a Start-up. A business is not merely built on a brilliant idea; seed capital facilitates the blooming of every startup that comes into existence. Hence, the schools are expected to pitch their idea to the Judges and the Dragons. Interestingly, the participating schools are themselves the Dragons which makes the event all the more gripping. Their sole motive being to woo the investors to invest in their respective startups.Participants need to understand that a brilliant idea doesn\u2019t guarantee a successful business. Hence they need to know their business inside out to withstand the grilling by the judges and the Dragons which shall take the form of a Question\/Answer session. \r\nMake it simple. But significant. \r\n\r\n\r\nBOSCO HOUSE OF CARDS\r\n \r\nThis is the second segment of Bosco Mad Men which shall take place in intervals whilst Bosco Dragons Den is underway.All the schools will be given a seed capital of Rs. 5,00,000 which they will use to invest in the different Start-up ideas which are being pitched by the different schools. This event will require the participants to do some number crunching and analyze the viability of the business plans of the different schools. This event puts the participants in the shoes of a Venture capitalist who has to distribute the Rs. 5,00,000 in the different startups in order to get maximum returns from the respective investment. The quality of the portfolio will significantly affect the performance of the respective schools, in a way that it can push themup the ladder of the schools or get it disqualified. The dynamics of the concept has been explained in detail in the general rules.\r\nThe only word of caution to the participants is to keep in mind two rules:\r\n \u2022 Rule 1 : Never lose money \r\n \u2022 Rule 2 : Don\u2019t forget Rule 1\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Rules\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n1. No. of Participants: 3+1\r\n\r\n2. Duration of Pitch: 4+1 minutes.\r\n\r\n3. Participants will not be allowed to exceed the time limit.\r\n\r\n4. This event is exclusive for the students of classes 11 and 12.\r\n\r\n5. Every school is required to pitch their start-up ideas to the Dragons and the Judges. The idea must be novelwhich shall be judged on the basis of how innovative, financially sound and realistic it is. \r\n\r\n6. After pitching the idea, a question\/answer session will take place where the Dragons,i.e,the other schools, and the Judges will ask questions to the pitchers.\r\n\r\n7. In addition to the pitching, the participants will also be marked on their tenacity to withstand the grueling Question\/Answer session. The participants are advised to analyze the markets they will be targeting for their respective startups and explain the scope of growth of the business in the respective market.\r\n\r\n8. The participants can make use of the projector to explain their Business idea. (Powerpoint presentations will be looked upon favorably)\r\n\r\n9. After each block of school completes their pitching and question answer session, Bosco House of Cards, that is, the investing event will take place intermediately. \r\nExample: If School A, B and C are in one block then school A will pitch its idea following the Question\/Answer session, then school B will do likewise followed by school C. After school C finishes its Question\/Answer session, Bosco House of Cards, the investing event will take place.\r\n\r\n10. Bosco House of Cards primarily involves the schools using their seed capital of Rs.5,00,000 to invest a percentage of it in the different start-ups. \r\n\r\nExample: Let us assume the first block of schools including School A, B andC have finished pitching their idea and question\/answer session. Following this all the schools including the ones who have pitched their idea will decide whether they wish to invest x% of their Rs. 5,00,000 in the start-up ideas of either School A, B or C. \r\nLet\u2019s assume school C is deeply impressed with School A\u2019s business plan and hence it decides to invest 50% of its Rs. 5,00,000. They will be left with Rs.2,50,000 of their seed capital. The significance of this investment has been explained in detail later. \r\n\r\n11. The schools have to keep in mind that they can invest in any school\u2019s business idea EXCEPT THEIR OWN. \r\n\r\n12. Investment should not be less than 10%.\r\n\r\n13. Investment has to be in whole numbers. \r\n\r\n14. The schools also need to keep in mind that they have to invest in AT LEAST ONE SCHOOL\u2019S IDEA FROM EACH BLOCK. \r\nExample: Let us assume there are 15 schools participating, then they will be divided into 5 blocks of 3 each. So every school needs to invest in at least one school from each segment.\r\n15. IN CASE A SCHOOL DOES NOT INVEST IN AT LEAST ONE STARTUP FROM EACH BLOCK, THEY WILL BE DISQUAILFIED IMMEDIATELY.\r\n16. The schools\u2019 also need to note that if they EXHAUST THEIR SEED CAPITAL OF Rs.5,00,000 BEFORE THE LAST BLOCK OF SCHOOLS START PITCHING THEIR BUSINESS IDEAS, THEY WILL BE DISQUALIFIED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe significance of the investment has been explained with the help of an example:\r\nLet\u2019s assume there are 6 schools participating in the event namely A, B, C, D, E and F. They are divided into two blocks:\r\n Block 1: School A, B and C \r\nBlock 2: School D, E and F \r\n\r\n\u2022 The first event that is Bosco Dragon\u2019s Den will take place which will involve Block 1 of schools\u2019 to come up and pitch their ideas to the Judges and the Dragons,the Dragons being the different schools themselves. After each pitch the question\/answer session will take place. Following which the judges will assign a score to the start-up idea on a scale of 1-10.\r\n\r\n\u2022 At end of Block 1, Bosco House of Cards will take place which is the investing round. Let\u2019s say school B decides to invest 50% of its Rs. 5,00,000 in School A\u2019s business idea, 30% in School C\u2019s business idea and 20 % of its seed capital in school F\u2019s business idea. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Now let us assume the judge marked School A \u2013 8\/10, School B \u2013 6\/10, school C \u2013 9\/10, and School F \u2013 5\/10.\r\nNow calculation of scores for School B will be calculated in the following way:\r\n\r\n Judges score \u2013 6\/10 = 6*100 = 600 points. \r\n\r\n 50% investment in School A\u2019s idea = 50*Score received by Team A =50*8 = 400 points. \r\n\r\n 30% investment in school C\u2019s idea = 30*9 = 270 points\r\n\r\n 20% investment in school F\u2019s idea = 20*5 = 100 points. \r\n\r\n TOTAL POINTS = (600+400+270+100) = 1370 POINTS\r\n\r\nBudding Entrepreneurs make every detail perfect and limit the number of details to perfect!","isOnstage":"0"},{"id":"19","name":"Glee","description":"\"I'll be there for you ...\", now your turn!","rules":"Number of Participants: 3 participants per school\r\n\r\nDuration: 180 minutes\r\n\r\nGeneral Rules:\r\n\r\n1.
